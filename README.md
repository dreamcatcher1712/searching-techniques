LINEAR SEARCH:
a sequential searching algorithm where we start from one end and check every element of the list until the desired element is found. It is the simplest searching algorithm.
BINARY SEARCH:
an algorithm for finding an element's position in a sorted array. In this approach, the element is always searched in the middle of a portion of an array.
